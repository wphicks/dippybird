# dIPpybird
Keep track of your IP address via e-mail reports

## Overview
dIPpybird is a tool to help keep track of a machine's IP address via e-mail
reports. It can be used as a decentralized replacement for DynDNS tools or
anytime it's useful to keep track of a changing IP address in an automated way.

Note: This project is something I hacked together in about a day awhile back.
It's not terribly pretty, but I'll probably slowly improve it over time. I've
posted it here in case it's of use to someone else.
